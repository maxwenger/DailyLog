Playing around with network streams.

## Streams and Networks in C#

*If a list is a bucket, a stream is a hose.*

* You can pull or push data in a stream **only once** and in **one direction**

* Types of streams
  * **Base** streams will work *directly with the backing store* (i.e. `FileIO`).
  * **Composite** streams will work *on top of another stream* (i.e. Encryption).

```csharp
public class MyEncryptionCompositeStream {
    public MyEncryptionCompositeStream(FileIO myFileBaseStream) {
        // Code!
    }
}
```

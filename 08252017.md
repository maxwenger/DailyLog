Working on Cisco API (remote monitoring for cisco devices).

---

## APIC

* Application policy infrastructure control
* Automates management, configuration, etc.
* Central repository for configurations

I stopped looking into this because it did not look relevant to my goals. This did not seem to be implemented and supported by normal Cisco devices.

### Summary

APIC (Application policy infrastructure control)is a technology used by big organizations to remotely manage and configure specialized Cisco equipment.

## .Net Standard

I wanted to look into this to see if it would be easy to build this project off something that could be ran on multiple platforms. Also seemed neato.

### Terms

* A **BLL** is a base class library, I assume that's like regular .Net, .Net Core, Xamrin, etc.

### Notes

* .Net Standard tries to unify BLLs.
* Replacement for portable class libraries (PCLs).
* Bigger version number = more APIs; smaller = less compatibility.
* PCL vs. Standard
  * Your app calls PCL calls BLL
  * Your app calls BLL calls standard
